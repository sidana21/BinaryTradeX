# Trading Platform

## Overview

This is a binary options trading platform built with a React frontend and Express backend. The application allows users to trade on various financial assets (forex, crypto, commodities, indices) with real-time price updates via WebSocket. Users can execute CALL/PUT trades with configurable expiry times, manage demo and real account balances, and track their trading history.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Framework & Build System**
- React with TypeScript for type safety
- Vite as the build tool and development server
- React Router (Wouter) for lightweight client-side routing
- TanStack Query for server state management and caching

**UI Component System**
- Shadcn/ui component library based on Radix UI primitives
- Tailwind CSS for styling with custom design tokens
- Dark mode theme with neutral color palette
- Custom CSS variables for theming consistency

**State Management Strategy**
- TanStack Query for server state (assets, trades, price data)
- Local React hooks for UI state (selected asset, timeframe, trade amount)
- WebSocket integration for real-time price updates
- Custom hooks pattern (`use-trading`, `use-websocket`) to encapsulate business logic

**Trading Interface Components**
- `TradingChart`: Canvas-based chart visualization for asset prices
- `AssetList`: Categorized list with search and filtering capabilities
- `TradingPanel`: Trade execution interface with amount controls
- `TradesPanel`: Displays open positions and trade history

### Backend Architecture

**Server Framework**
- Express.js with TypeScript for type-safe API development
- HTTP server with WebSocket upgrade for real-time communication

**Note on Database Configuration**
The application is configured to use PostgreSQL through Drizzle ORM and Neon's serverless driver. While the in-memory storage is currently used for development, the schema and configuration are ready for PostgreSQL deployment. The `DATABASE_URL` environment variable must be set for database connectivity.
